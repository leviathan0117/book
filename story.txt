It was the day of the launch. John wasn't ready. It's not that he didn't train or something, in fact, he was working as hard as possible, but there are still things you just can't be prepared to... After all, there was only one person that went to space before him. Everything went OK, and the news of the flight spread through the whole world so fast and far, that even the outer northern reams heard of this impossible feat, but most people don't even think about what happened behind the scene. What troubles the so famous Mike went through, and what was the cost of all this to him? Ten days until the launch moment, Mike came to John and spoke to him. They sat of one of the benches in a park west of the launch pad and mission control center and gossiped when suddenly Mike stood up and said: "My friend... I know that you did your best, and I wish so much I could help you. Alas, when the door of the pod will close - there will be no turning back. And the success of the mission will depend only on you. Of course, everyone at the control center would do everything possible to help you, and they will mention it a lot, but once you reach the orbit they will be just too far to rescue you. So don't try to pull away that feeling of discomfort, that will intensify with every second, after all, it is unnatural for a human to be there, and this feeling should be left as a reminder of the dangers around... I wish you the best of luck and will meet you at this place on June the 26th, and don't you dare not to show up".

Now, five hours until the dreading moment, on the early morning of June the 21st, John was again sitting in the park, the conversation deep in his mind. He was afraid of everything that awaited him, but he wasn't nervous, he was happy of the adventures ahead, but they scared him. Ever since the moment when he woke up, he was feeling quite strange - actually he never felt like that. Both happiness and fear combined in one single feeling, that slowly emerged deep from inside of him. All of a sudden, a streak of light fell on his face - the rocket that would carry him to orbit was lifted onto the platform and no longer shaded the rising morning sun. He stood up, looking towards the main control center and space station command building on either side of the launchpad, reached into his pocket and out came a present from his friend. It was a mechanical barometer in the form of pocket clocks, engraved with beautiful patterns. Odri gave this to him the previous day with the words: "May it always protect you and remind you of home". She never answered why she gave it to him. The only explanation was that it might come in usefull in space, but in case of decompression he will still be quite aware, so he just thought, that it was as good a thing as any other present. John stood there for a few minutes, turning the barometer and thinking about the conversation with Mike, the words "the success of the mission will depend only on you" spinning in his head, but finally placed it back into his pocket and set off for the control center. While walking there, he finally understood why Mike always told the press it was the hardest thing he'd ever done - he would have to complete it alone. The mission of his country and the whole world would be his burden.

Finally, he reached the control center. Everyone he met wished him luck, but he was too deep in himself to react until an announcement brought him back - he was called to the third floor to get ready. Suddenly, realizing that he was late, he rushed for the staircase, and up to the preparation room.
-Ah, here you are! - said Bill, the director of the whole control center.
Bill was a quite tall and muscular man, wearing a black suit. He was one of those people, that seem to know what exactly they were doing, even when they did something out of sheer randomness. This probably was the main reason he became the center's director, aside a bright mind. of cource. He held a microphone in one hand and some paper in the other. Most likely, he was preparing his speech to the press. John was standing in the middle of the room, people gathering around him, as he noticed that Bill was expecting some sort of explanation.
-I was... - replied John, just to break the silence.
-Where have you been? - said another voice.
He turned and saw Odri - his advisor and best friend. She was a beautiful woman, nineteen years old, with light brown hair, that always seemed orange in sunlight, hazel eyes, always smiling. If seen at random, she would most likely wear a T-shirt and jeans, tree rings on her right middle finger, and a necklace around her neck. Smart and persistent, Odri was always studying, which was not only her duty, but also a sort of a hobby, which both made her a very interesting character for a conversation, but also made this conversations as rare, as a precious stone. Although she was very kind, one would not want to put her out, especially by trying to annoy her - that would end any conversation immediately and would be quite a hard thing to undo, but if carefully 'treated' she was an enormously good friend.
-I was in the park... - hastily said, John.
-And what on earth you've been doing there?...
-I was prepar...
-Come on, give him a slack - after all, it's a good thing to calm your nerves before such a flight, - interfered Bill.
He seemed to understand that it was a bit hard for John and decided to be slightly easier on him. Odry gave Bill a sharp glance, but looking back on John smoothed a little, probably realizing that there is no time for explanations.
-Fine, let's go - we don't want to be late for the meeting, - she said at last.
And so they've all headed towards the strategy room on the fourth floor. When they've reached it, Odri gave a smiling look to John and they both entered. It was a huge hexagonal room with every wall except for the entrance as a huge screen showing maps, blueprints, real-time data from all 3 satellites on orbit and a huge image of proposed trajectory of John's rocket. In the center was a huge round table with an exact scaled copy of the Caelestis spaceport in its center and small screens facing each seat. Every seat except for two closest to the entrance and one in the back were occupied by commanders, officers, engineers, and representatives from other countries. Bill went to the free seat in the back, while Odri and John took the others.
-OK, so let's start, - said Bill, after they've all seated, begining the finall meeting before the start - the last chance to turn back without creating an emergency situation.
He pressed a few buttons on the keyboard before him and a set of large screens descended from the ceiling until they were floating above the table. They showed a diagram of the launch plan.
-Fortunately, the weather is good for now. Will there be any changes? - he addressed the meteorologists.
-Um... The weather would stay the same - sunny, but we noticed a strengthing southern wind, so we might need to change the trajectory or wait for some time, hoping that the wind would cease, - answered one of the meteorologists.
-We can't wait - the Aria satellite would be in an optimal position for docking once in five hours, and a delay even for thirty minutes would cost us more fuel than a counter-wind trajectory change, - answered one of the engineers.
-Let's put it like this: we will recalculate the trajectory, taking into account the strengthening wind, and just before the start we'll check the weather status again. If the wind would rise enough to endanger the mission, then we'll delay the start until Aria's next lap, hoping that the wind would cease, - Bill summed up.
-We can give our meteo-stations for that, - said a representative of a more southern located country.
-That is good! And how about the Aria's condition? - asked Bill.
-Oh, it's actually really good - when John would reach it, all batteries would be 100% charged, it's right angulled, so we don't have to turn it... and, by the way, the on-board temperature was lowered, as asked, - answered one of control center's monitoring personnel.
-So everything is OK, at least for now? - asked John.
-Actually, everything is not that good... We have been spying on our southern enemies and noticed something suspicious. Some of the nearest airports have been preparing their long-range bombers, - said the on of the army officers.
-You suppose that they might plan an attack on the spaceport? - asked Bill with a clear note of frustration.
-I don't suppose; I know for sure, - replied the officer - even if they don't know about the millitary impotance of the mission, they know for sure that this is a very expencive mission. If the spy's report was correct, they will strike in two hours, just to make sure we will lose the money spent on the space program.
-And when was the last report recieved?
-Just about now.
-So we have just a bit more than an hour to start the rocket, or we can wait until the army will fend off their attack.
-I don't think we should wait for the attack to cease... Any, just any harm to the Sunbeam rocket could throw us back for days or even weeks, - interfered Charles, one of the engineers.
-I think Charles' right. We have to start the rocket as soon as possible, before the attack begins, - suddely said John - in addition we won't risk anything... right?
-The only thing we would lose is the official part of the launch: press, talking to the audience and so on, but I guess we'll lose it anyway - if we decide to wait for the enemy, we will need to evacuate all the audience, so we don't really have anything to argue about, - replied Bill.
There was a long pause with everyone looking at John, who seemed to either ignore it or just wasn't noticing. Finally Bill came to a decision.
-Ladies and gentlemen, the time to launch the Sunbeam came! We can't wait, but we don't need to. We are always ready and this time is not an exception. I wish us all luck, and may this flight be recorded in history as a triumph of all humanity! - finished Bill.
Everyone clapped and started leaving from the room, but John, Bill, and Odri stayed.
-Come on, we need to get you a costume, - said Odri when everyone left.
-Don't you worry, John, you will succeed, - Bill tried to cheer up John, who seemed a bit lost.
-I'm not worried about the flight, I'm just concentrated, - answered John in a more lively tone, and it actually seemed that he was sincere.
-Let's rock&roll then, - replied Odri, standing up from het seat.

After the meeting they ran to the control room for a quick briefing. Well...It should have been quick... Even though this was supposed to be a ten minute news update, the guy who was on it was Morpheus. And even though he was the best suited person for this job, he was a programmer, so he was explaining everything in such a manner that everyone had to prosess his words for a minute or so, before getting the slightest clue of what he was talking about. In addition to Morpheus, the briefing was not only for John, but to the control room crew, which meant there were ten times more question. After more than half an hour of this whatever you call this, Odri and John ran out of the control room, not even daring to look at the watches - it was obvios they were late, and they didn't want to know how much.

They quickly returned to the preparation room and went to the back of it and through a large door. In the center stood a crane, with a space suit hanging from it, a platform beneath it. The walls were littered with different suit parts and tools. In the back was a large panoramic window on the park. The suit itself was quite thin to give more flexibility, but because it was built to protect from all kinds of dangers including decompression, it was very heavy, so it was impossible to put it on without additional help. Therefore, John and two guys from the staff raised on the platform under the suit, and while John was climbing into the suit, Odri was standing near, calling out suggestions and recommendations. After 10 minutes or so, they've finally finished, and set off for the exit of the control center - it was time for John to board the rocket. 

It was now 15 minutes until the start, and a huge screen near the rocket pad started counting minutes and seconds down. After a 3 minutes walk, they came near a supporting tower on the rocket pad. Bill and chief engineer were already there, waiting for them. Two guards stood on both sides of the entrance to the lift, that would carry the astronaut to the cabin. They were there, because for security measures only the astronaut, Bill and one of the engineers were allowed to go there. John turned around, to see Odri's eyes, shining with the same feeling, John had experienced this morning. Without a word, she gave him a hug, and, her eyes saying "bye", left for the station control center, located on the other side of the space center, glancing over her shoulder. John would've liked to stare at her forever, but because Bill was obviously feeling uncomfortable, he had to turn, just as Odri gave him a last smile.
-Don't worry, you'll have enough time to talk before docking to Aria, - assured Bill, now making the situation uncomfortable for John too.
-Let's do this quick, - replied John, eager to hcange the topic.
They've entered the small cabin, and the engineer pressed a few buttons to make the lift rise. During the ride, John took another overview of the park and mountains behind it, wondering how would they look from space, and whether he would recognize their's well-known paths. A sudden jolt of the stopping lift brought him back, and when the doors opened, the tree of them entered a small bridge that led towards the cabin. They went toward the rocket in absolute silence. It was originally supposed that people would cheer them up as they aproached the rocket cabin, but because all press and viewers were evacuated, the only thing than John heard was his own heartbeat. John stopped for a second to take a last look on the Caelestis space port, but the real reason was to find Odri. He saw her almost in space station command building, looking in his direction. It seemed to him, that she sent him an air-kiss and turned to enter. An unpleasant thought of whether he would ever see her again came to his mind, but he pushed it away and turned to enter the cabin.
The engineer opened the cabins door, then he and Bill wished John luck, and after John climbed in, the engineer closed the metal door. Just before the door closed, words of Mike again came to his mind.
-I'm ready to take responsibility for this mission, - he said quietly to himself, sincerely believing his words.

The cabin itself looked like a cone from outside, with a space station module on top of it. On both sides were control interfaces of different kids. Above John was a port, connecting the pod to a habitat-module, that stored oxygen tanks, CO2 scrubbers, various equipment for the flight and, of course, the military experement he was about to perform. After John slipped himself to the seat, he lowered a hanging set of displays from the top, which would display most of the information during the flight. He turned on a few switches, powering the inner lights and the system.
-This is Sunbeam, Caelestis do you receive? - said John after powering radio systems on.
-This is mission control center Imperium, hear you good, everything fine?  - replied a voice on the radio.

At first, it was proposed that Odri would be on the radio with him, but because she was at the station control center, which could control only the space station itself, the only center that had acsess rights to command this operation was Imperium. To allow Odri to speak to him, he would have to dock to Aria satellite - then it would have at least 3 modules attached to it, at least two people from different missions on it, and a stable orbit around the planet - which would immediately classify it as a space station. After that, he would have to change cryptographic keys onboard, which would make Aria not just any space station, but due to emerald class encryption keys, the main planet station(and the only).

-Got everything under control, powering main systems and preparing for liftoff. When trajectory data will be updated?
-It's 7 minutes until launch, so in about two minutes, but it was already updated about fifteen minutes ago.
-OK, starting system check, - answered John. He pressed a row of switches to 'on' position, and screens before him flashed, showing data from all the sensors on board. One by one he ran through the values to check, crossing out lines on a list, he took from a pocket near him. After he was sure everything was fine, he started preparing the rocket for start. Even though most of the settings were pre-installed - he had to set out some, that were set to default for security reasons. "Oxygen from the lower stage, CO2 to the atmosphere, electric supply from outer batteries, engine safety off" - he muttered under his nose as pressed buttons on a keyboard before him.
-Trajectory ready, prepare to upload, - said someone on the radio.
-Ready to receive, - answered John, allowing trajectory upload.
-It hasn't changed a lot, but it might be usefull to take a look at it, - suggested the radio voice.
As John was studying the trajectory another 2 minutes passed, and he heard a loud siren at space center - 3 minutes to start.
-Imperium, asking flight permission on pod one! - said John in a very lively tone, now being a little on the nerves.
-Permission granted, close the fairing, start final check.
-Working on that.
John turned a large button and clapped accident-press defense on it - if pressed it would release the fairing, which he certainly didn't want to do on earth. The bridge to his cabin started to move away and fairing around his cabin and the fairing around the space module and him started to close with a hum. Exactly when it closed, the siren went on again - two minutes.
-Is everything OK? - said a familiar voice on the radio.
-Yeah, let's rock&roll! - replied John to Bill.

Meanwhile, at the space station control center, Odry was watching screens, showing rocket and listened to the talks on the radio. The look on her face made it obvious she was nervous, but she wasn't the only - everyone was feeling both excited and nervous. When the last siren cut the air she shriveled - only a minute until the start. She glanced at the timer and noticed that seconds were passing abnormally fast.
-Twenty seconds until liftoff - all systems online, prepare to remove safety switches, - said the same radio voice, and even though nobody noticed, Odri was starting to hate that voice. She wanted to give everything to be the one on the radio now - but that would've meant she would not have rights to talk to him after docking because John would not be under Imperious' control.
-Removing safety switches, - replied John.
-Prepare for the countdown.

The timer went red and showed the countdown.
-Countdown start, - said the voice - 10... 9... 8...
-Starting engines, - said John, but Odri could barely hear him through the pulsing of blood in her ears.
-7... 6... Primary fixation released... 4..., - continued the operator.
-Wait, the pressure is too big! - cried John all of a sudden.
The automatic siren went off, and Odri's heart sunk deeper than ever - two seconds until lift-off, but the flames were too small. Cold seized her, as she dashed for the exit of the facility. She ran past all the others, counting in her mind seconds until the start. 1... 0... She almost reached the exit when rocket's engines should have started, but it was still silent. She flew out of the building, -2 seconds until liftoff, just as a terrible blast pierced the morning air. She stumbled and fell, turning in mid-air to see a huge cloud of burned fuel quickly rising above the rocket pad, shrouding the barely visible fairing of the rocket. Tears in her eyes, she was falling, terrible fear taking control over her. She hit the ground, no sight of the rocket, the sound of burning fuel getting stronger and stronger. Purely white clouds were now all over the launch pad. A second passed, but it seemed like endless torture for her, she didn't even notice that she fell, pure despair surging through her until suddenly she saw Sunbeam rise above the cloud with an astounding roar. She didn't believe her eyes, as Sunbeam gained altitude and speed, shooting towards space. She finally realized, that she was still on the ground, standing up, just to see Sunbeam break the sound barrier. It was the summer solstice, and the sun was just on the equator, so Sunbeam seemed to fly exactly to the sun. This was why Sunbeam had its name.
